# [Product Roadmap: Home Assistant Voice Streaming Add-on]

## 1. Vision and Tech Stack
* **Problem:** Enable real-time voice streaming with minimal latency in Home Assistant using WebRTC for immediate response to voice commands.
* **Proposed Solution:** Develop a custom Home Assistant component that integrates WebRTC for low-latency audio streaming, processes audio in real-time, and triggers Home Assistant events based on voice input.
* **Tech Stack:** Home Assistant (Docker), Python (aiortc, aiohttp), JavaScript (WebRTC API, LitElement), Nginx, Docker Compose, STUN/TURN servers.
* **Applied Constraints and Preferences:** Must use Docker for containerization, avoid Node.js as per strict constraint, and follow MVS principle by avoiding rendering complexities.

## 2. Core Requirements (from fact research)
1. Set up a complete Home Assistant environment with Docker Compose including HTTPS configuration for WebRTC.
2. Create a custom voice streaming component with WebRTC-based real-time audio capture and processing.
3. Implement a frontend dashboard card using LitElement for user interaction with the voice streaming feature.
4. Optimize the entire stack for minimal latency including proper RTCPeerConnection settings and audio processing parameters.
5. Ensure secure communication with SSL certificates and proper authentication mechanisms.

## 3. Prioritized Functional Modules (designed to achieve the above requirements)
| Priority | Functional Module | Logical Basis (from research) | Description (includes grouped features) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Environment Setup and Docker Configuration | Establish foundational infrastructure with Docker and configure Home Assistant for WebRTC compatibility | Docker installation, directory structure creation, docker-compose.yml setup with host networking, SSL certificate generation, Nginx configuration for HTTPS and WebRTC proxying |
| 2 | Basic Home Assistant Configuration | Prepare Home Assistant core to support custom components and panels | Update configuration.yaml with necessary components (websocket_api, http, panel_custom), install essential add-ons (SSH, Samba) |
| 3 | Voice Streaming Component Foundation | Create the basic structure and configuration files for the custom component | Directory structure setup, manifest.json definition, __init__.py creation, services.yaml file |
| 4 | WebRTC Backend Implementation | Develop the Python server-side logic for handling WebRTC connections and audio processing | Implement WebRTC connection management, audio stream tracking, real-time processing, and Home Assistant event triggering |
| 5 | Frontend Dashboard Card | Build a user-friendly interface using LitElement for interacting with the voice streaming feature | Create voice-streaming-card.js with recording controls, status indicators, latency monitoring, audio visualization, and settings panel |
| 6 | Voice Receiving Card | Create a specialized card for receiving and playing back voice streams | Implement voice-receiving-card.js with playback controls, audio visualization, and connection management for receiving audio streams |
| 7 | Performance Optimization and Integration | Fine-tune the entire stack for minimal latency and integrate all components | Configure startup scripts, TURN server settings, optimize RTCPeerConnection parameters, verify end-to-end functionality with testing |

## Completed Modules

### 1. Environment Setup and Docker Configuration
